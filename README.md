<h1>Hi, I am Brendan!</h1>

I am a Year 2 Undergraduate studying at Singapore Management University, pursuing a degree in Bachelor of Science (Information Systems).

I am passionate about technology and its potential to transform the world, and I am excited to be studying in a field that is at the forefront of this transformation. Throughout my coursework, I have gained a solid foundation in topics such as data management, programming, and systems analysis, and I am constantly seeking new opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills.

If you're interested in connecting with a driven, ambitious student with a passion for technology and innovation, please feel free to reach out. I would be honoured to connect with you and explore potential opportunities.
